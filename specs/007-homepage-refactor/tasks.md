# Homepage Features Refactor Tasks

This document lists the tasks that were performed to refactor the `HomepageFeatures` component.

- [x] Create a directory for the new components at `frontend/src/components/HomepageFeatures/`.
- [x] Break down the `HomepageFeatures` code from `frontend/src/pages/new component/index.tsx` into smaller, more manageable components.
- [x] Move the associated styles to the new component directory and update the global theme.
- [x] Update `frontend/src/pages/index.tsx` to use the newly refactored `HomepageFeatures` component.
- [x] Remove the old `frontend/src/pages/new component` directory.
- [x] Generate the `sp constitution`, `specify`, `plan`, and `tasks` documents for this refactoring effort.
