# Tasks Quality Checklist: Auth + Personalization

**Purpose**: Validate tasks completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-26
**Feature**: [../spec.md](../spec.md)

## Task Completeness

- [X] All functional requirements from spec.md are covered by at least one task.
- [X] Each task has clear, actionable steps.
- [X] Each task has defined acceptance criteria.
- [X] Dependencies between tasks are identified (if any).
- [X] Tasks are granular enough to be estimated and completed independently.

## Task Quality

- [X] Tasks avoid implementation details where possible (focus on *what* to achieve).
- [X] Task descriptions are clear and unambiguous.
- [X] References to relevant spec/plan sections are provided for each task.
- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.

## Next Steps

- All items marked incomplete require task updates before implementation.
- Once all tasks are complete, implementation can begin.
