# Quickstart Guide for Urdu Translation Feature

This feature will be integrated directly into the Docusaurus frontend. There are no separate quickstart steps for end-users beyond interacting with the UI button.

For developers:
1. Ensure the backend FastAPI service is running.
2. Ensure the Docusaurus frontend is running.
3. Navigate to any chapter page in the Docusaurus site.
4. Click the "اردو میں ترجمہ کریں" button to see the translation modal.
