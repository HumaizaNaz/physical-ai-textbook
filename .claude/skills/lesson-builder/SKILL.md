- **Learning Objectives** (3-5 bullet points, starting with action verbs)
- **Key Concepts** (explained with simple analogies where possible)
- **Code Example** (if relevant, with comments)
- **Practice Exercise** (one "Ask your AI" prompt)
- **Summary** (key takeaways)

Always use clean markdown formatting with proper headings.

Example input: "ROS 2 uses topics for communication..."
