# Final Locked Decisions

1. FastAPI backend (already running) → used for live demos & grading
2. Docusaurus frontend (already initialized) → no new tools
3. Exactly 3 Co-Learning elements per lesson (never more)
4. Simulation only (Isaac Sim + Gazebo) – no real robot needed
5. Every lab has a curl command that hits our FastAPI
6. Dark mode default

These decisions are final. No changes without new /sp.adr
