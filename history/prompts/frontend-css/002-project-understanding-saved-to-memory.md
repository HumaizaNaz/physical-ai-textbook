# 002 - Project Understanding Saved to Memory

## Context

Following the comprehensive review of project documentation (`README.md`, `00-ADR.md`, `00-PLAN.md`, and the `constitution.md` template), a clear understanding of the "physical-ai-textbook" project was established. This understanding is critical for all future interactions and tasks.

## Actions Taken

1. **Saved Project Understanding to Memory**: The core details of the "physical-ai-textbook" project, including its FastAPI backend, Docusaurus frontend, content structure, and key constraints, were saved into the agent's long-term memory using the `save_memory` tool.

## Outcome

The agent's memory now stores the essential context of the "physical-ai-textbook" project, ensuring consistent understanding and adherence to project requirements in subsequent tasks.
