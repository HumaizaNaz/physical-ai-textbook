# 016 - Created RAG Step 4 Final Chatbot Embed Specification

## Context
The user provided detailed instructions for the fourth and final step of the RAG pipeline for the "physical-ai-textbook" project. This step involves building and embedding a fully functional RAG chatbot into the Docusaurus frontend, and a comprehensive specification document was required for this process.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/rag/004-rag-step4-final-chatbot-embed-spec.md`**: A comprehensive specification detailing the objective, functional and technical implementation requirements (including floating bubble, full chat window, "Ask AI about this" feature, API connection details, CSS styling), and expected outcome for the RAG chatbot. The file was placed in the `history/prompts/rag/` subdirectory.

## Outcome
A clear and exhaustive specification for the RAG chatbot integration into the Docusaurus frontend has been documented. This blueprint outlines the development of the chatbot component, its global injection, styling, and connection to the FastAPI RAG backend, marking the completion of the RAG pipeline documentation.
