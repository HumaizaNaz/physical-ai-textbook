# 015 - Created RAG Step 3 Final FastAPI Cohere Only Specification

## Context
The user provided detailed instructions for the third and final step of the RAG pipeline for the "physical-ai-textbook" project. This step involves setting up a FastAPI endpoint to expose the RAG functionality using Cohere for chat and Qdrant for retrieval, and a specification document was required for this process.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/rag/003-rag-step3-final-fastapi-cohere-only-spec.md`**: A comprehensive specification detailing the objective, tooling, implementation details (including the full Python code for `backend_RAG/main.py`), execution and testing requirements, and expected outcome for the FastAPI RAG endpoint. The file was placed in the `history/prompts/rag/` subdirectory.

## Outcome
A clear specification for the final RAG FastAPI endpoint has been documented. This provides a blueprint for implementing and testing the RAG chatbot, completing the backend RAG pipeline and enabling its integration with the Docusaurus frontend.
