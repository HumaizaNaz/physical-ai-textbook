# 017 - Created AWSCC Provider Resources Listing Processing Plan

## Context
The user provided snippets of AWS Cloud Control API (AWSCC) resource listings and requested a `/sp.plan` document to outline how to process and utilize this data.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/017-awscc-resource-listing-plan.md`**: A detailed plan outlining the objectives, phases (data extraction, storage, and potential utilization), and deliverables for handling the AWSCC Provider Resources Listing data. This plan also suggests a structured JSON format for the extracted data. The file was placed in `history/prompts/`.

## Outcome
A clear, step-by-step plan for processing the AWSCC resource data has been established. This plan provides a roadmap for transforming raw text into a structured, usable format and suggests various ways this information could be leveraged within the project.
