# 028 - Created Teaching Assistant Agent Specification

## Context
As part of defining Claude agents for the "physical-ai-textbook" project, the specification for the "Teaching Assistant" agent was required. This agent will provide student-focused support.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/agents/agent-001-teaching-assistant-spec.md`**: A document detailing the definition, objective, personality, skills (`chapter-summarizer-physical-ai`, `concept-explainer-physical-ai`, `quiz-maker-robotics`), greeting, and RAG enablement for the Teaching Assistant agent. It also specifies the two file locations for its JSON definition. The file was placed in `history/prompts/agents/`.

## Outcome
A clear specification for the Teaching Assistant agent has been established, guiding its creation and integration as a key support persona within the textbook.
