# 013 - Created RAG Step 1 Playwright Crawl Specification

## Context
The user provided detailed instructions for the first step of a RAG pipeline for the "physical-ai-textbook" project. This step involves crawling the textbook content using Playwright to bypass anti-bot measures, and a specification document was required for this process.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/rag/001-rag-step1-playwright-crawl-spec.md`**: A comprehensive specification detailing the objective, tooling, implementation details, execution requirements, and expected outcome for the Playwright-based content crawling. The file was placed in the new `history/prompts/rag/` subdirectory.

## Outcome
A clear specification for the initial RAG content crawling step has been documented. This provides a blueprint for implementing the Playwright-based solution and ensures adherence to the user's requirements for bypassing anti-bot protections and structured data extraction.
