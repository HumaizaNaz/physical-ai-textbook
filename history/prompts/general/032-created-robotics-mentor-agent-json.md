# 032 - Created Robotics Mentor Agent JSON Files

## Context
As part of implementing the agent definitions, the JSON configuration for the "Robotics Mentor" agent needed to be created in both the `frontend/public/agents/` and `.claude/agents/` directories.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `frontend/public/agents/robotics-mentor.json`**: The JSON definition for the Robotics Mentor agent was created in the public frontend directory.
2.  **Created `.claude/agents/robotics-mentor.json`**: The JSON definition for the Robotics Mentor agent was created in the internal Claude agents directory.

## Outcome
The "Robotics Mentor" agent's definition has been successfully implemented in both required locations, making it available for both frontend display and backend Claude invocation.

Robotics Mentor agent created in both folders.
