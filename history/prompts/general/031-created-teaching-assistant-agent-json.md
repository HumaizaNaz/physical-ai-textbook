# 031 - Created Teaching Assistant Agent JSON Files

## Context
As part of implementing the agent definitions, the JSON configuration for the "Teaching Assistant" agent needed to be created in both the `frontend/public/agents/` and `.claude/agents/` directories.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `frontend/public/agents/teaching-assistant.json`**: The JSON definition for the Teaching Assistant agent was created in the public frontend directory.
2.  **Created `.claude/agents/teaching-assistant.json`**: The JSON definition for the Teaching Assistant agent was created in the internal Claude agents directory.

## Outcome
The "Teaching Assistant" agent's definition has been successfully implemented in both required locations, making it available for both frontend display and backend Claude invocation.

Teaching Assistant agent created in both folders.
