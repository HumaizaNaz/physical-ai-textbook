# 018 - Created SP.Create Official Skills Structure Specification

## Context
The user provided detailed instructions for creating a professional `.claude/skills/` directory structure, complete with five specific skill folders and their corresponding `SKILL.md` files, including YAML frontmatter and markdown content. A specification document was required for this process.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/018-sp-create-official-skills-structure-spec.md`**: A comprehensive specification detailing the objective, folder structure, and precise content for each of the five `SKILL.md` files (robotics-code-generator, concept-explainer, chapter-summarizer, quiz-master, lesson-builder). The file was placed in the `history/prompts/`.

## Outcome
A clear and exhaustive specification for setting up the official Claude skills structure has been documented. This blueprint outlines the creation of specialized AI tools that will support various tasks within the "physical-ai-textbook" project.
