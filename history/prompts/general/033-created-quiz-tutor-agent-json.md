# 033 - Created Quiz Tutor Agent JSON Files

## Context
As part of implementing the agent definitions, the JSON configuration for the "Quiz Tutor" agent needed to be created in both the `frontend/public/agents/` and `.claude/agents/` directories.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `frontend/public/agents/quiz-tutor.json`**: The JSON definition for the Quiz Tutor agent was created in the public frontend directory.
2.  **Created `.claude/agents/quiz-tutor.json`**: The JSON definition for the Quiz Tutor agent was created in the internal Claude agents directory.

## Outcome
The "Quiz Tutor" agent's definition has been successfully implemented in both required locations, making it available for both frontend display and backend Claude invocation.

Quiz Tutor agent created in both folders.
