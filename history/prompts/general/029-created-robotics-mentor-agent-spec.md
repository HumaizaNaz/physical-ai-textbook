# 029 - Created Robotics Mentor Agent Specification

## Context
As part of defining Claude agents for the "physical-ai-textbook" project, the specification for the "Robotics Mentor" agent was required. This agent will provide practical, code-first, and industry-expert guidance.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/agents/agent-002-robotics-mentor-spec.md`**: A document detailing the definition, objective, personality, skills (`code-generator-robotics`, `concept-explainer-physical-ai`, `lesson-formatter-physical-ai`), greeting, and RAG enablement for the Robotics Mentor agent. It also specifies the two file locations for its JSON definition. The file was placed in `history/prompts/agents/`.

## Outcome
A clear specification for the Robotics Mentor agent has been established, guiding its creation and integration as a key technical guidance persona within the textbook.
