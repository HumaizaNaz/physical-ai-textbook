# 030 - Created Quiz Tutor Agent Specification

## Context
As part of defining Claude agents for the "physical-ai-textbook" project, the specification for the "Quiz Tutor" agent was required. This agent will provide exam-oriented support and assessment.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/agents/agent-003-quiz-tutor-spec.md`**: A document detailing the definition, objective, personality, skills (`quiz-maker-robotics`, `chapter-summarizer-physical-ai`), greeting, and RAG enablement for the Quiz Tutor agent. It also specifies the two file locations for its JSON definition. The file was placed in `history/prompts/agents/`.

## Outcome
A clear specification for the Quiz Tutor agent has been established, guiding its creation and integration as a key assessment and exam preparation persona within the textbook.
