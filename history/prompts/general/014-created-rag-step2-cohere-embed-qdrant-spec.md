# 014 - Created RAG Step 2 Cohere Embed and Qdrant Upload Specification

## Context
The user provided detailed instructions for the second step of a RAG pipeline for the "physical-ai-textbook" project. This step involves chunking the crawled content, generating embeddings using Cohere, and uploading them to Qdrant, and a specification document was required for this process.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `history/prompts/rag/002-rag-step2-cohere-embed-qdrant-spec.md`**: A comprehensive specification detailing the objective, tooling, implementation details, execution requirements, and expected outcome for the Cohere embedding and Qdrant upload process. The file was placed in the `history/prompts/rag/` subdirectory.

## Outcome
A clear specification for the second RAG step has been documented. This provides a blueprint for implementing the embedding and vector database population solution, crucial for enabling efficient retrieval in the RAG pipeline.
