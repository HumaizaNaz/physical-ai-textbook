# Task Example: Concept Explainer

## Context
This document provides a concrete example of how the `concept-explainer` Claude skill would be invoked and what its expected output would be. This demonstrates the skill's capability to explain complex Physical AI or robotics concepts with simple language and a real-world analogy.

## Skill Invocation
The `concept-explainer` skill would be invoked with a specific Physical AI or robotics concept to be explained.

### Prompt Example
```
Explain "Embodied Intelligence".
```

## Expected Output
A clear, concise explanation of the concept, including one real-world analogy.

### Example Output Structure
````markdown
Embodied intelligence refers to the idea that an intelligent agent's cognitive abilities are deeply dependent on its physical body and its interactions with the environment. It suggests that intelligence doesn't just happen in a "brain" in isolation, but emerges from the sensorimotor experiences gained through having a body.

**Real-world Analogy:** Think of a chef learning to cook. They don't just read recipes (the "brain" part); they physically chop vegetables, feel the texture of dough, smell ingredients, and adjust heat on a stove. Their understanding of cooking, and their skill, is deeply tied to these physical interactions with tools, ingredients, and the cooking environment. A chef who only reads recipes but never cooks physically will never develop the same "embodied intelligence" in the kitchen as one who actively engages with the physical process.
