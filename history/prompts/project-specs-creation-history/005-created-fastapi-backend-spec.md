# 005 - Created FastAPI Backend Specification

## Context
Continuing the process of documenting the "physical-ai-textbook" project's specifications, the next logical step was to outline the backend architecture that supports the interactive elements and API integrations.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `fastapi-backend-spec.md`**: A detailed specification describing the core usage, architecture, principles, key components (application entry point, API routers, data handling), dependencies, and integration points for the FastAPI backend. API endpoint guidelines were also included. The file was placed in `frontend/docs/`.

## Outcome
A clear specification for the FastAPI backend has been established. This document will guide the development of the backend services, ensuring they align with the project's interactive requirements and integrate seamlessly with the Docusaurus frontend.
