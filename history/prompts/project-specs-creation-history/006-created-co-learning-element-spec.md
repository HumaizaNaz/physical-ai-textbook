# 006 - Created Co-Learning Element Specification

## Context
Following the documentation of the Docusaurus platform and FastAPI backend, the next critical step was to detail the "Co-Learning elements," a core and recurring interactive component mandated for each lesson in the "physical-ai-textbook" project.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `co-learning-element-spec.md`**: A specification defining the purpose, core principles, example types (quizzes, code execution, visualizations, mini-simulations), and integration methods for Co-Learning elements within the Docusaurus frontend. The file was placed in `frontend/docs/`.

## Outcome
A clear and comprehensive guide for designing and implementing interactive Co-Learning elements has been established. This ensures consistency and adherence to the project's educational methodology across all textbook chapters.
