# 010 - Created SP.Specify Theme Specification

## Context
The user provided a new CSS snippet intended as a custom Docusaurus theme (`sp.specify-theme-v1`) and requested a new specification file for it, detailing its color palette and application instructions.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `010-sp-specify-theme-spec.md`**: A detailed specification outlining the custom Docusaurus theme. This includes its purpose, global typography enhancements, responsive adjustments, and a comprehensive breakdown of its color palette for both light and dark modes, as well as the styling for "glass-card" elements. The file was placed in `frontend/docs/`.

## Outcome
A clear and documented specification for the new custom Docusaurus theme has been established, which will guide its application and future modifications within the "physical-ai-textbook" project.
