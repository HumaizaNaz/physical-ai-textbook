# 004 - Created Docusaurus Platform Specification

## Context
The user requested creation of `.sp.specify`-style and planning files for the "physical-ai-textbook" project, specifically asking for guidance on what files to create and in what order. The first file identified was the Docusaurus Platform Specification.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `docusaurus-platform-spec.md`**: A detailed specification outlining the core usage, configuration, theming, navigation, content authoring, custom components, integration points, and versioning for Docusaurus within the project. The file was placed in `frontend/docs/`.

## Outcome
A foundational specification for the Docusaurus frontend platform has been established, serving as a reference for its implementation and customization within the "physical-ai-textbook" project.
