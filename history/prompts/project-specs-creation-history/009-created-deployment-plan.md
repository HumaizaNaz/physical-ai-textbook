# 009 - Created Deployment Plan

## Context
With the specifications for the frontend, backend, and interactive elements defined, and a testing strategy in place, the final major planning document is the Deployment Plan. This outlines how the "physical-ai-textbook" project will be made available to users.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `deployment-plan.md`**: A comprehensive document detailing the strategy and procedures for deploying both the Docusaurus frontend and FastAPI backend. It covers objectives, deployment architecture (hosting options), the deployment process (CI/CD), rollback strategy, environment/secrets management, and monitoring. The file was placed in `frontend/docs/`.

## Outcome
A clear and systematic plan for deploying the "physical-ai-textbook" project has been established. This ensures a robust and automated approach to making the application accessible, maintainable, and scalable.
