# 007 - Created Live Curl Integration Specification

## Context
Following the documentation of Docusaurus, FastAPI, and Co-Learning elements, the next essential specification is for the "1 live curl → backend" feature. This feature is a mandatory interactive component for every chapter, allowing direct interaction with the FastAPI backend.

## Actions Taken
1.  **Created `live-curl-integration-spec.md`**: A detailed specification outlining the design, implementation, and presentation of the live `curl` functionality. It covers core principles, functionality (display, copy, optional in-page execution), implementation details for both frontend (Docusaurus) and backend (FastAPI), and provides an example workflow. The file was placed in `frontend/docs/`.

## Outcome
A clear specification for integrating live `curl` commands into the textbook has been established. This ensures a consistent and effective approach to demonstrating backend interactions and reinforcing learning concepts throughout the "physical-ai-textbook" project.
